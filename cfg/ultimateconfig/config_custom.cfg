//# Please read through the config files to understand what each config file does. Each section will

//# All settings here are set to their most optimal value. You are free to change the settings.
//#
//# For the purpose of making updating the config seamless and not to override your changes, please make
//# all your changes to config_custom.cfg instead of ultimateconfig.cfg
//#
//# I have listed below a variety of requests that I have received multiple times, as well as things
//# that I have tried out and feel are useful. Please feel free to use them. They are commented out

//# Stop infinite cycle in inventory switching - helps to scroll to pills and smg/sg quicker without overscrolling
//# or underscrolling (similar to an option in Valorant). Only downside is that even if that slot is empty, the
//# mousewheel bind will still be on it, so regardless if the slot is empty or not, the binds are going to "call"
//# that slot. For example, if you have an empty kit/defib slot, if you scroll slowly, you'll notice that
//# the slot selected will not change for 1 tick of the scroll. It's like simulating pressing 1 2 3 4 5 regardless
//# if there is an item in the slot or not.

//# Most servers running competitive configurations have restricted rates for spectators to allow
//# players in survivor/infected to have more bandwidth/priority. The change in lerp and rates is
//# due to this reason. Having 100 rates on spectators while the server enforces 30 rates makes
//# the game look jittery while spectators are watching. Also, the lerp change to 100 is intended
//# to prevent a spectating player from accidentally moving into the teams (when map change),
//# which can cause an issue if they are AFK.
