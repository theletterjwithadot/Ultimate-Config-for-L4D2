//# I have listed below a variety of requests that I have received multiple times, as well as things

//#	These bindings/aliases are primarily used for servers that run competitive configurations. You can adjust the keys used to your liking.

//# Bind F1 and F2 to do ready and unready and also recordfix

// bind "F2"										"Vote No; sm_unready"

//#
// alias "+quickpilleat"							"slot5; +attack"
// alias "-quickpilleat"							"-attack; slot1"

//# Stop infinite cycle in inventory switching - helps to scroll to pills and smg/sg quicker without overscrolling
//# or underscrolling (similar to an option in Valorant). Only downside is that even if that slot is empty, the
//# mousewheel bind will still be on it, so regardless if the slot is empty or not, the binds are going to "call"
//# that slot. For example, if you have an empty kit/defib slot, if you scroll slowly, you'll notice that
//# the slot selected will not change for 1 tick of the scroll. It's like simulating pressing 1 2 3 4 5 regardless
//# if there is an item in the slot or not.

//# Most servers running competitive configurations have restricted rates for spectators to allow
//# players in survivor/infected to have more bandwidth/priority. The change in lerp and rates is
//# due to this reason. Having 100 rates on spectators while the server enforces 30 rates makes
//# the game look jittery while spectators are watching. Also, the lerp change to 100 is intended
//# to prevent a spectating player from accidentally moving into the teams (when map change),
//# which can cause an issue if they are AFK.
